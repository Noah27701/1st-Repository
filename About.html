Noah Polley will be attending his senior year at Radford University this upcoming Fall. His major focus is theatre, more specifically, acting. He is currently attending
summer classes at RCC to obtain extra credits before he graduates. He hopes to graduate on time and purse a carrier in Shakespearean acting with a touring Shakespeare
company. Noah has always been interested in the arts and loved diving into them, from music to dance, he always enjoyed participating and honing his inner artist. He
hopes to continue on this path, learning as much as he can about the different jobs and trades in our world.

The idea of programming and just how computers worked interested Noah since he was 10. He was baffled and stunned by what writing code could achieve. Most of his major
influences were his dad, who went to school for a two-year computer science degree, his friends who took computer science classes, and his love for video games. A lot of
his life was wanting to take classes, but always being afraid that he wouldent be able to understand or keep up with what he was learning. He eventually came to the
conclusion that not doing something because you are afraid to fail is the first step to never succeeding, so he decided to try as much as he can and let failure shape
his learning instead of preventing it.
